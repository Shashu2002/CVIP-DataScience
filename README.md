# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing global terrorism incidents. The project aims to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist attacks using data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis is conducted using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which provides detailed information about terrorist incidents worldwide. The dataset includes attributes such as date, location, attack type, target, casualties, and more.

## Key Objectives

- Identify regions with the highest frequency of terrorist incidents.
- Explore the distribution of attack types and their outcomes.
- Analyze trends in terrorist activity over time.
- Investigate the relationship between various factors, such as terrorist group affiliations and attack targets.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing and executing code.
- GitHub: Used for version control and collaboration.

## Files and Directories

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with the EDA code and visualizations.
- `images/`: Images used in this README or generated by the analysis.

## Running the Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files to see the step-by-step EDA process and visualizations.

## Results

Some of the insights derived from the analysis include:

- The most affected regions by terrorism incidents.
- Distribution of attack types (e.g., bombings, armed assaults).
- Trends in terrorist activities over the years.
- Common targets and their distribution.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based on available data and might not capture all terrorism incidents accurately.
- Factors such as data collection methods and reporting biases can impact the results.
