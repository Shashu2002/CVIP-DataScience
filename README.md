## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing global terrorism incidents. The project aims to gain insights into patterns, trends, and characteristics of terrorist attacks using data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Dataset

The analysis is conducted using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which provides detailed information about terrorist incidents worldwide. The dataset includes attributes such as date, location, attack type, target, casualties, and more.

## Key Objectives

- Identify regions with the highest frequency of terrorist incidents.
- Explore the distribution of attack types and their outcomes.
- Analyze trends in terrorist activity over time.
- Investigate the relationship between various factors, such as terrorist group affiliations and attack targets.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing and executing code.
- GitHub: Used for version control and collaboration.

## Files and Directories

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with the EDA code and visualizations.
- `images/`: Images used in this README or generated by the analysis.
